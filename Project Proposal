Project Name: “Bangla Money Recognition “.

Description:
It’s an machine learning based project. For this project there are 1631 train data set and 333 testing data set. And Ratio between train 
dataset : test dataset is 1:5 . Each image shape is 120*250*3. First an algorithm will train the training datasets and find out the accuracy
.Then training datasets noise will be reduced by Gaussian Filter [1].Again the same algorithm will train the training datasets and find 
the accuracy. Finally the code will be uploaded an android app(Camera). Whenever it takes an picture and tell us what’s the note is. 

Tools:

i)Language: python

ii)Platform: Jupyter

iii)Framework: Android

iv) Algorithm: KNN , Linear Regression
